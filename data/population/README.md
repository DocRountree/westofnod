# Population content

What grows and lives on the land. `scripts/population/population.gd`
(`Population`, a child of Main) streams it in 64 m chunks round the player,
generated on worker threads from a per-chunk seed, so the same things are
always in the same places and nothing needs saving.

- `props/*.tres`: `PropKind` (trees, rocks, grass). Mesh, material, density
  per biome (per hectare; `"*"` = any other biome), scale range, ground
  alignment, slope and height limits, view distance, and `radius` (solid:
  the player and actors walk round it; 0 = walk through, e.g. grass).
  Each kind in a chunk is one MultiMesh.
- `actors/*.tres`: `ActorKind` (NPCs, animals). A scene whose root extends
  `Actor`, density per biome (groups per km²), group size and spread, and
  `persistent` (named NPCs: not freed when the player leaves). Actors spawn
  within `Population.actor_radius` (160 m) and are freed beyond it.
  Override `Actor.think()` for behaviour; movement over the terrain (and
  round props) is done for you.

Biomes: forest, mesa, prairie, swamp, tundra, taiga, plateau, volcano,
mountains, island, coast (`""` = land with no biome).

Runtime hooks: `Population.prop_at(pos, r)` / `remove_prop(uid)` (felling,
picking up; removals are kept for the session), `push_out(pos, r)`,
`register_prop()` / `register_actor()`, `stats()` (and `/pop` in the chat).
